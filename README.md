----
The repository contains the official implementation for the paper "DPMesh: Exploiting Diffusion Prior for Occluded Human Mesh Recovery" (CVPR 2024).

DPMesh is an innovative framework for occluded human <ins>**Mesh**</ins> recovery that capitalizes on the profound <ins>**D**</ins>iffusion <ins>**P**</ins>rior about object structure and spatial relationships embedded in a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model.
